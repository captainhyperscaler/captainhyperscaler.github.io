<p>Hello, my name is Dwayne.&nbsp; I have been dubbed "Captain Hyper-scaler" by some of my co-workers, so I thought it had a nice ring for a blog URL.&nbsp; I think of myself as a life-long learner when it comes to technology.&nbsp; Hopefully, you are as well.&nbsp; This blog will focus on various topics from personal experiences, cloud technologies, training and certifications, and miscellaneous tech ramblings.&nbsp; I have designed this site to categorize these posts in these categories, depending on what you may feel is the most relevant.&nbsp; Let's enjoy our journey and keep each other company.&nbsp; Have a great day!</p>
