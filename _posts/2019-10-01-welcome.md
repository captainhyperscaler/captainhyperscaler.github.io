Hello, my name is Dwayne.

I have been dubbed "Captain Hyperscaler" by some of my co-workers, so I thought it had a nice ring for a blog URL.

I think of myself as a life-long learner when it comes to technology. 

Hopefully, you are as well. 

This blog will focus on various topics from personal experiences, cloud technologies, training and certifications, and miscellaneous tech ramblings.

I have designed this site to categorize these posts in these categories, depending on what you may feel is the most relevant.

Let's enjoy our journey and keep each other company.

Have a great day!
