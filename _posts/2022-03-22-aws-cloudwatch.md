This is the first post of content for preparing yourself for becoming an AWS Solutions Architect Associate.

In this post, we are going to focus on CloudWatch on AWS.

As I have done previously let's look at the similarities and differences to the closest equivalent in Azure. CloudWatch is the monitoring service for performance on AWS and the equivalent to Azure Monitor.

Monitors the performance within AWS for:

- Compute
    - EC2 instances
    - Autoscaling groups
    - Elastic load balancers
    - Route 53 health checks
- Storage and Content delivery
    - EBS volumes
    - Storage Gateway
    - CloudFront

CloudWatch with EC2 can monitor at a host level (every 5 minutes by default):
- CPU
- Network
- Disk
- Status check

CloudTrail increases the availability by recording console actions and API calls.  This is activity monitoring and NOT performance. This is for auditing who is accessing resources.


I hope that you are enjoying this information so far.  It is helping me to continue to comprehend these services as I prepare for the exam myself.  Thank you very much.
