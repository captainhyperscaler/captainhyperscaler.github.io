<p>In the spirit of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AzureFamily?src=hashtag_click">#AzureFamily</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AzureAdventCalendar?src=hashtag_click">#AzureAdventCalendar</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AzureSpringClean?src=hashtag_click">#AzureSpringClean</a>, I will be continuing the momentum with an end of summer event in September. Reach out to me on Twitter (@DwayneNcloud) or LinkedIn if you'd like to contribute a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AzureBacktoSchool?src=hashtag_click">#AzureBacktoSchool</a> topic, please provide the topic and a preferred date, if you have one.  Currently, I have this slotted as a weekday event, but if I get more volunteers than days, I will increase the days and participants per day. So, don't be shy! ðŸ˜‰</p>
