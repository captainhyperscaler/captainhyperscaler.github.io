<p>Microsoft Azure has a wide range of services built into their cloud ecosystem. These services provide the ability to monitor resources, create and set policies, and identify and mitigate threats within not only the Azure infrastructure, but also to external resources for a consistent security posture across an organization. In the<a href="https://www.skylinesacademy.com/blog/2020/2/5/azure-security-part-1"> first post</a> of a series of three articles on <strong>Azure Security</strong>, we focused on the services that make up the foundation of an organizationâ€™s security program. Our <a href="https://www.skylinesacademy.com/blog/2020/3/3/azure-security-part-2-understanding-azure-policies">second article</a> provided guidance on how to use <strong>Policies</strong> and<strong> Initiatives</strong> to govern our Azure environment.  In this, our third article, we will discuss how we can manage our environment through Security Center with the use of alerts and automation workflows.</p>
