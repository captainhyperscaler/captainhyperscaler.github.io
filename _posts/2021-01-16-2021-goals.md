<p>2020 was challenging in many ways to many.  I'm not going to dwell on that, but I do wish anyone reading this continued health, happiness, and safety to them and their families. </p>

<p>As I summarized in my last post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/12/18/2020-a-reflection/" target="_blank">2020â€¦a reflection</a>, the year was personally and professionally fulfilling for me. So, what goals do I have for 2021? Let me outline those for you now. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. I had the opportunity to speak at a number of user groups and conferences virtually in 2020. I would like to continue this in the coming year, where I have already been accepted as a speaker for the Scottish Summit and MCT Middle East Summit this quarter, with more submissions hopefully to be accepted. My goal would be to speak at 12 conferences and user groups in 2021, at a minimum. I think that I'm off to a good start. ðŸ˜€</p>

<p>2. From a certification perspective, my goals have tempered from previous years. Over the past 24 months, I have earned 13 Azure and Microsoft 365 certifications. In 2021, my first goal is to earn the Microsoft 365 Administrator Expert by passing MS-100 and MS-101, and then finish my Data Engineer Associate by passing the DP-201. Based on the current exams available, I may take a break for a while after those. Unless there are some more security and compliance exams added. </p>

<p>3. I plan to continue to lead the content development and training team at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.opsgility.com" target="_blank">Opsgility</a> and continue to provide great instructor led training, lab development, live talks, and coaching to students that are looking to grow their Azure, Microsoft 365, and Power Platform knowledge. </p>

<p>4. I would like to talk about overall community involvement. I will continue to help the Microsoft community through being a MCT Regional Lead and MVP. Both of which I hope to continue beyond the current volunteer and award periods, respectively. This will also include participating in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.azurespringclean.com/" target="_blank">Azure Spring Clean</a> in March, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cloudlunchlearn.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Lunch and Learn</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://maz365usergroup.github.io/" target="_blank">MW Azure and M365 user group</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://azurebacktoschool.tech" target="_blank">Azure Back to School</a> 2021. </p>

<p>5. Other contributions that I will provide will be to continue to post what I hope that you find helpful content here, along with video content on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtube.com/c/CaptainHyperscaler" target="_blank">Captain Hyper-scaler YouTube</a> channel. And while we are on the topic of branding, I'm very happy to announce that we of January 2021, Captain Hyper-scaler is now a registered trademark within the USPTO. </p>

<p>In closing, I hope to also get involved with Microsoft Ignite in some capacity again in March, and participate in my first MVP Summit. I want to thank everyone in the community that provides and shares their time and opportunities with others within the community. The Microsoft community is unlike any other, and I'm so happy to be welcomed and to be a part. I will continue to help others, be inclusive, and be positive in what I do as I strive to be the best community member that I can be. Thank you very much for allowing me.</p>
