<p><strong>About the AZ-500 and Azure Security Engineer Associate Badge</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within the Azure cloud infrastructure certifications, there are varying tracks that can be taken depending upon your role or interest.&nbsp; Security Engineer Associate is one of those tracks.&nbsp; The Security Engineer Associate certification is obtained through passing of a single exam, AZ-500.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the past eight months, Microsoft has completed a transition within their Cloud certification program from their traditional MCP, MCSA, MCSE certifications to the Role-based programs.&nbsp; These Role-based exams and certifications align with the various areas of production applications (M365), customer experience (Dynamics 365), and cloud infrastructure (Azure).&nbsp;</p>
