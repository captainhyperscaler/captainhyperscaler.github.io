This is the first part of a series that I have decided to begin as I start a new journey.

As someone that has been working toward Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 certifications for the past three plus years, I have started to expand to obtaining certifications with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  I have a current goal of obtaining the Solutions Architect and Security certifications for these two hyperscalers over the course of this year.

I have recently begun that journey with the AWS Solution Architect Associate exam.  As someone that has gone through the process of studying, passing, and renewing the Azure Administrator Associate and Azure Solution Architect Expert certifications, I am finding that there are many consistencies between them and AWS.  

There are some differences that you and I need to understand, and the terminology is different between Azure and AWS.  So, I am going to help myself in preparation by documenting these differences in hopes that it will help others that have the same aspirations for Azure, AWS, and GCP.

Below is the list of topics that I plan to cover and document.  Check back here for updated links as well as at our homepage: <https://captainhyperscaler.github.io>.  After I have completed the AWS series, stay tuned for the same for GCP.

Let's begin our journey together. Thank you.
