<p>In my previous post, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/01/09/2019-year-in-review/" target="_blank">http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/01/09/2019-year-in-review/</a>, I provided a summary of how I continued to grow, develop, and spread knowledge within the Azure community.  In this article, I will provide some ways that I have thought of to continue sharing and growth in 2020.  </p>

<p>As I spent the holiday with my family, I reflected on the past year and what I would like the next year to look like for me professionally.  As I try to do every year, I make note of specific goals that I set out to accomplish in the next year.  This may come in the form of a simple list or sometimes evolves into a formal business plan depending on the complexity of my goals.  This year I have a combination of both.  The formal plan is my goals within my organization, which I will keep confidential.   The list are ways that I can continue to contribute to the Azure and Cloud community.  These are what I will share with you now.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media contributions</strong>.  Today, I have begun the first item on my list, and that is continuing (and stepping up) my social media/blog contributions.  When I started this blog a few months ago, I had an initial plan to provide a new article every month.  My plan is to double that output in the coming year plus add more video content and demos as well.  The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Azure Advent Calendar (opens in a new tab)" href="https://azureadventcalendar.com/" target="_blank">Azure Advent Calendar</a> was such a fun project and I enjoyed the video portion of that post, so I definitely plan to do more.</p>

<p>In addition to my own blog site, I want to continue to assist other contributors in the community where I can with their calls for content.  This will include participating in the <a href="https://www.azurespringclean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Spring Cleaning </a>event in February.  I have contributed in the past to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Skylines Academy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://courses.skylinesacademy.com/?affcode=180879_p1mljie2" target="_blank">Skylines Academy</a> and hope to continue to assist them in the coming year.</p>

<p><strong>Community Training Workshops</strong>.  To continue to utilize my MCT, I have been looking at ways this week to find ways within the community to educate more individuals on Azure.  This includes looking into high school STEM programs that may have a need or want to learn about cloud hosting technologies and build the certified Azure workforce pool.  I will be getting more involved in the local MeetUp groups for Azure and Cloud users and help them fill any training and education gaps.</p>

<p><strong>MCT Regional Lead</strong>.  Becoming a MCT Regional Lead was very important to me and to be selected to me is a privilege.  I plan to do everything that I can to support Microsoft educational programs and help out my MCT counterparts on a continual basis.  This will include being involved in the MCT Regional Lead summit in a couple of months.</p>

<p><strong>Certifications</strong>.  The last point of emphasis for me in 2020 is with certifications.  Much of 2019 for me was focused on getting Azure certifications.  Though I will continue to learn and grow, I only have a few certifications that I am focusing on for 2020.  Those would be to complete the DP-201 exam and obtain my Data Engineer Associate certification,  complete AZ-400 as the second step and achieve my DevOps Engineer Expert certification, and attempt to get my M365 Enterprise Administrator Expert certification.  I also am going to work toward the Microsoft Certified Educator certification.</p>
