![](/images/cgrc/rmf1.png)

This is the series of articles to use as a study guide for the (ISC)2 CGRC exam.  In this article, we will discuss the Categorize steps in the Risk Management Framework.


### Categorize Tasks ###

  FIPS 199
  
  CMSS 1253
- C-1 – System Description
- C-2 – Security Categorization
- C-3 – Security Review and Approval- 

### Categorize Task Details ###


- C-1 – System Description
  - Input – system design, system elements, authorization boundary
  - Output – Documented system description
  - Primary role – System Owner (SO)
  - Related tasks – P-8, P-9, P-10, P-11 (all system related prepare tasks)
  - SDLC - initiation

- C-2 – Security Categorization
  - Input – risk management strategy, org risk tolerance
  - Output – impact levels for information type and security objectives, categorization based on high water mark
  - Primary role – System Owner (SO) and Information Owner/Steward (IO)
  - Related tasks – C-1, P-2, P-3, P-14, P-6, P-11, P-12, P-13
  - SDLC – initiation (concept/requirements)
  - FIPS 200 – HWM
  - CNSSI 1253 – high, moderate, low impact to CIA
  - FIPS 199 – Security categorization based on 
  - 800-59 – function, operation, and use of the system

**800-60 Impact Definitions**

**Low**
- Limited adverse affects to CIA
Cause a degradation with organization able to continue to perform primary functions
Result in minor damage, minor financial loss, or minor harm to individuals

**Moderate**
- Serious adverse affects to CIA
Significant degradation and effectiveness/function is reduced
Significant damage to assets, financial loss, or harm to individuals

**High**
- Severe or catastrophic effects to CIA
Severe degradation or loss of mission capability
Major damage to assess, financial loss, or harm to individuals

**FIPS 199 Impact Definitions**

- Confidentiality
   - Low
   - Moderate
   - High
- Integrity
  - Low
  - Moderate
  - High
- Availability
  - Low
  - Moderate
  - High

- C-3 – Security Review and Approval
  - Input – impact levels for information type and CIA, HWM categorization, high value asset list.
  - Output – Approval of security categorization
  - Primary role – AO, AO DR, Senior Agency Official for Privacy (if PII is involved)
  - Related tasks – P-10, P-12, P-13, C-2
  - SDLC – initiation (concept/requirements)

After identifying the systems and categorizing information, you move to the Select process for controls.
