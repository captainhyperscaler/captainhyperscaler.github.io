- R-2 – Risk Analysis and Determination
- R-3 – Risk Response
- R-4 – Authorization Decision
- R-5 – Authorization Reporting

- 800-37

- OMB Circular A-130 – Managing Information as a Strategic Resource


### Authorize Task Details ###

  - Input – security and privacy plans, assessment reports, plan of action and milestones, supporting assessment evidence or other documentation.
  - Output – Authorization package
  - Primary role – CCP and SO and AO
  - Related tasks – S6, I2, A4, A6
  - SDLC – implementation/assessment
  - Package includes: Executive summary and inputs above

- R-2 – Risk Analysis and Determination
  - Input – authorization package, supporting assessment evidence, information provided by senior accountable official for risk management or risk executive
  - Output – risk determination
  - Primary role – AO or AODR

    - Risk mitigation changes the risk factor by reducing or eliminating:
    - Likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

  - Primary role – AO only
  - Related tasks – P2, R2, R3
  - SDLC – implementation/assessment
  - Authorization decision details: T&C, auth termination date or time-driven reauth frequency, events that trigger review of authorization, system impact level
  - Type authorization – common version of a system
  - Facility authorization – controls for a defined environment

- R-5 – Authorization Reporting
