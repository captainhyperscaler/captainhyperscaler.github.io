As mentioned in my [2022...The Year so Far](https://captainhyperscaler.github.io/about-updates/2022/04/30/year-so-far/) post on 30 April 2022, I have been asked to be the Community Manager for Packt Publishing's Security Pro Community.

Anyone that is involved or interested in security, cloud, on-premises, and hybrid is invited to join.  The community is run on Discord. The link is below.
**Security Pro Community Manager for Packt. For security professionals, join here: <https://discord.gg/VCXG6wcuQc>**.

We are currently growing rapidly and, as Community Manager, I want to do things to help the SecPro community to get involved with events, share knowledge with each other, participate, and learn.

I have already created some new categories for events and conferences, and certifications to allow for community members to post and support each other.

Packt also has a website with a newsletter that you are welcome to subscribe here: [Subscribe to SecPro newsletter](https://secpro.memberful.com/referral/v8r58z9)

I will continue to post updates on my site as they the community evolves and additional content is included for collaboration.

I hope to see you there, be sure to wave to say "Hi" when you join!
