<p>Azure Back to School is here again for 2021. &nbsp;<a href="https://azurebacktoschool.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://azurebacktoschool.com</a> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event will focus on a month of videos on Microsoft cloud technologies. &nbsp;This year, we will open it up to Microsoft 365 and Power Platform as well, even under though still under the Azure title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep in the spirit of education, I would like this event to be used as a mentoring opportunity. I would like our experienced community contributors to find someone that is interested in presenting but may be hesitant. Work with them on the Azure (or Microsoft 365 or Power Platform) topic, and create a video presentation together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The goal is to get more people comfortable with contributing and growing our #cloudfamily community. Hopefully, everyone will find this as a fun way to mentor others and provide content to the community.  Everyone is welcome and no one will be turned away. Thank you very much. </p>

<p>Call for speakers is open here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sessionize.com/azure-back-to-school-2021" target="_blank">https://sessionize.com/azure-back-to-school-2021</a>.  Content that we are looking for is around Azure, Microsoft 365, and Power Platform.  We are looking for video contributions with two contributors per submission.  This is meant to be used as a mentoring event for our experienced contributors to co-presenter with someone less experienced. We all began contributing in this community because someone gave us the first opportunity. This is our chance to have an event to kick start new content and contributors. No one will be turned away. We will find from for everyone. Thank you very much for your support. </p>
