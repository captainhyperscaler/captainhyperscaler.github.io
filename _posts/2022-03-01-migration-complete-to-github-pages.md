Migration Complete to GitHub pages from WordPress

Today, I tore off the band aid and redirected https://captainhyperscaler.com to GitHub pages.

I had begun to publish my new blog posts to the GitHub pages site over the last 30 days, but had yet to re-direct to the new site.  Mainly because I do still have some formatting on some of the old posts that were moved from WordPress.

This site now has a category page with posts sorted by year, and quick links to my Sessionize profile, Azure Back to School site, and the new Gimme Cloud Talks group site.

Here are some things that I learned in this process:

- Unless you are using an expensive business level WordPress plan, migration is a very manual process.  These business plans allow you to use the plug-ins to WordPress that could be used to copy the entire site.  Not having this capability forced me to copy every post and paste each one into a markdown file for GitHub.  
- The above process requires cleanup.  I still have to do some cleanup on old posts because they are using html in markdown.  This doesn't render the best within GitHub.
- Building the new site in GitHub pages with Jekyll is very easy.  I evaluated a number of free Jekyll templates for GitHub pages to find the one that worked best for my site.
- I'm going to save money in this new setup.  GitHub pages is free, so all that I am paying for is the custom URL.  No longer do I need to pay BlueHost for my WordPress site, and I like the look of the new site much better than the WordPress template that I was using.

I still have some integrations that I want to get active, like Google analytics for reporting on traffic and a contact form.  Overall, I'm very happy with the end result. 

I hope that you feel the same.  Have a great day and thank you for your support.
