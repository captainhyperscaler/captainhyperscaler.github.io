<p>Part 1 of this series concluded on Friday, January 29 with Azure Sentinel, Part 1.  The episodes in this series focused on Azure security services, technologies, and best practices and kicked off on Halloween, October 31.  It included 13 videos spanning topics around Identity, Security, and Compliance within Azure.  The list of topics and links to the episodes can be found here: <a href="https://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/09/19/gimme-shelter-part-1-security-in-azure/">“Gimme Shelter” Part 1…Security in&nbsp;Azure</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2 will premiere on February 5, 2021</strong>, and will focus on Microsoft/Office 365 security. I hope that you continue to enjoy and learn from these short weekly videos. Subscribe to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIWicD_sUxH6EMH4ndG5NxQ" target="_blank">Captain Hyperscaler YouTube channel</a> for playlists and videos from all of my events. Thank you very much.  I have aligned these topics with those included within the Microsoft 365 Security Administrator exam (MS-500).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: I am pausing this series until June 2021.  Microsoft is in the process of expanding the certification program with some focus on Security, Compliance, and Identity.  This will most likely expand this series beyond originally planned 17 episodes, but I want to make sure that it provides the most value to viewers.  Thank you very much for understanding.</strong></p>
