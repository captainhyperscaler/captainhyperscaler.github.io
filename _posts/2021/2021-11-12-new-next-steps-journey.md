<p>It is mid-November 2021 and I have an announcement. I have chosen to take on a new challenge. As of today, I am no longer a direct employee of <a href="http://www.opsgility.com">Opsgility</a>. Monday, I will begin at <a href="http://www.cloudreach.com">Cloudreach </a>as a Senior Product Manager owning their multi-cloud migration services. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm very excited to be reunited with a former colleague of mine that I worked with and for at a previous company on the product development team. In addition to Azure, I will be working with AWS and GCP, so it provides me with an opportunity to continue to learn as well as teach. </p>

<p>Prior to my move up Opsgility to be an Architect and Trainer, I had spent 5+ years as a Product Manager. It combines my ability to architect and develop scalable services with the enjoyment that I have in sharing my knowledge and making everyone successful. I expect nothing but success from myself and Cloudreach in my new role. </p>

<p>Though I'm excited about this opportunity, it is with a heavy heart because of my time and respect for Opsgility. I was given the opportunity to learn so much and lead an amazing team of architects, project managers, and CSMs. I hope to continue to assist them when I can with training, coaching, or content in the future. The direction that Opsgility is trending is amazing and they are currently looking for Microsoft Certified Trainers and MVPs to assist in virtual deliveries of MOC courses, partner certification sessions, hack and workshop coaching, conferences, and content creation.  I will continue to assist them to maintain my MCT and provide great content to the learning community.</p>

<p>More to come as I continue my journey and contributions to the community. I wish everyone the best of luck in yours. </p>

<p>December 3, 2021 update. Three weeks ccompleted at Cloudreach and I am so energized by the people and culture. Everyone is welcoming and helpful. There is a "we all succeed together" attitude that is felt throughout.  I have started to get comfortable and have begun building the plans for expanding our Migration services to the next level of growth and scale. </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone in the community that have provided their best wishes and everyone at Cloudreach that has welcomed me to the Cloudreacher family. Next step is to get some AWS and GCP certifications. First up GCP Security Engineer. </p>
