<p>On June 22, 2020, I am starting a six part series for the <a href="https://www.cloudlunchlearn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Lunch and Learn sessions</a>. In this series, I will highlight key subjects within the objectives for the AZ-303 and AZ-304 exams in one hour sessions. </p>

<p>Typically, the courses for these exams are a week each. So, these six, one hour sessions will not be able to cover the full breadth of these two exams. The goal of these sessions is to provide you with some key focus areas for understanding that can guide you on your path to passing these exams. </p>

<p>I will enhance these sessions with a weekly article that provides additional links to study materials that I feel will prepare you to pass these exams. </p>

<p>The first session on Monday, June 22, 2020 provides an overview of the objectives for exam AZ-303 and AZ-304. This session can be accessed at 12:00 PM UTC at this link:  <a href="https://www.cloudlunchlearn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Lunch and Learn</a></p>

<p>As follow-up to these sessions, I recommend visiting Build5Nines.com and completing the exam self-assessments for the Azure Solutions Architect Expert exams: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://build5nines.com/free-oss-exam-self-assessment-tool/" target="_blank">Free Exam self-assessments</a>. Choose the AZ-300 and AZ-301 exams. These two exams retire on September 30, 2020 and will be replaced by the new exam numbers. </p>
