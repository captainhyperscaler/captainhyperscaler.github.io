<p>In this previous post, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/01/09/2019-year-in-review/" target="_blank">http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/01/09/2019-year-in-review/</a>, I provided a summary of how I continued to grow, develop, and spread knowledge within the Azure community last year.  In this article, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/01/09/2020-a-year-for-growth/" target="_blank">http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/01/09/2020-a-year-for-growth/</a>, I provided some ways that I have thought of to continue sharing and growth in 2020.  This article provides a "mid-ish" year update on my progress.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media contributions</strong>.  Today, I have begun the first item on my list, and that is continuing (and stepping up) my social media/blog contributions.  When I started this blog a few months ago, I had an initial plan to provide a new article every month.  My plan is to double that output in the coming year plus add more video content and demos as well.  I haven't gotten quite to two posts per month but I'm close. You will see in the updates below, I have been doing more video content. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Azure Advent Calendar (opens in a new tab)" href="https://azureadventcalendar.com/" target="_blank">Azure Advent Calendar</a> was such a fun project and I enjoyed the video portion of that post, so I definitely plan to do more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to my own blog site, I want to continue to assist other contributors in the community where I can with their calls for content.  This will include participating in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Azure Spring Cleaning  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.azurespringclean.com/" target="_blank">Azure Spring Cleaning </a>event in February.  I have contributed in the past to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Skylines Academy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://courses.skylinesacademy.com/?affcode=180879_p1mljie2" target="_blank">Skylines Academy</a> and hope to continue to assist them in the coming year, including Skylines Summer Sessions, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/MJSfpfs--UA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/MJSfpfs--UA</a>. </p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Community Training Workshops:</span></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To continue to utilize my MCT, I have been looking at ways this week to find ways within the community to educate more individuals on Azure.  This includes looking into high school STEM programs that may have a need or want to learn about cloud hosting technologies and build the certified Azure workforce pool.  I will be getting more involved in the local MeetUp groups for Azure and Cloud users and help them fill any training and education gaps. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>UPDATE</strong></span>: I had the privilege and honor of being the guest speaker at FOCUS:HOPE's virtual graduation in the spring (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/05/01/inspirational-day-speaking-at-a-virtual-graduation-ceremony/" target="_blank">http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/05/01/inspirational-day-speaking-at-a-virtual-graduation-ceremony/</a>). I loved hearing the great stories from some of the graduates and sharing my own career journey. </p>

<p>In the spring, I started an <strong>Azure and M365 user group</strong>. We have had monthly meetings and are getting great contributions from the Azure community, including some MVPs! <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://maz365usergroup.github.io/" target="_blank">https://maz365usergroup.github.io/</a></p>

<p>In June and July, I did a series of exam prep workshops for Cloud Lunch and Learn, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cloudlunchlearn.com/" target="_blank">https://www.cloudlunchlearn.com/</a>. One of these workshops was for Becoming an Azure Developer Associate and a six part series on Becoming an Azure Solutions Architect Expert. These sessions can be found on their YouTube channel: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CloudLunchandLearn" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/c/CloudLunchandLearn</a>. With more sessions to come soon. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In August, I began a YouTube video series, <strong>Breaking Down the Azure Network Chains</strong>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/08/06/breaking-down-the-azure-network-chain-youtube-series/" target="_blank">http://captainhyperscaler.com/2020/08/06/breaking-down-the-azure-network-chain-youtube-series/</a>, with weekly videos each week on an Azure network service. </p>

<p><strong>Azure Back to School </strong>premieres in September, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://azurebacktoschool.tech" target="_blank">https://azurebacktoschool.tech</a>, with a daily video or article from members of the community.  Filling the gap from Azure Spring Clean to Azure Advent Calendar. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>MCT Regional Lead:</strong></span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Becoming a MCT Regional Lead was very important to me and to be selected to me is a privilege.  I plan to do everything that I can to support Microsoft educational programs and help out my MCT counterparts on a continual basis.  This will include being involved in the MCT Regional Lead summit in a couple of months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>UPDATE</strong></span>: I'm so happy and privileged to be a part of this great group. Helping provide guidance to new MCTs and providing them with key information as it becomes available is very fulfilling. I've tried to get a group together quarterly, but it has been a bit slow in getting interest.  </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Certifications:</strong></span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last point of emphasis for me in 2020 is with certifications.  Much of 2019 for me was focused on getting Azure certifications.  Though I will continue to learn and grow, I only have a few certifications that I am focusing on for 2020.  Those would be to complete the DP-201 exam and obtain my Data Engineer Associate certification,  complete AZ-400 as the second step and achieve my DevOps Engineer Expert certification, and attempt to get my M365 Enterprise Administrator Expert certification.  I also am going to work toward the Microsoft Certified Educator certification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">UPDATE</span></strong>:  My certification focus has changed as the year progressed. I still plan to complete my Data Engineer Associate in the fall. I have received the Fundamentals exams for AI, Data, Power Platform, and Microsoft 365. I also passed my Teams Administrator Associate exam.  I'm working on more of the M365 certifications as well. </p>

<p>As you have read, I have put in place some clear ideas to continue my community growth and provide value to the Microsoft Azure community.  As is usually the case, plans require adjustments, which I have made as you've seen in this article. </p>
