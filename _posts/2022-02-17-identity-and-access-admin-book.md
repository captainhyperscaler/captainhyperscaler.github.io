**Identity and Access Administrator Associate Exam Prep book information**

As I mentioned in my previous post "Becoming an author", I recently completed my first published book with the Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator Associate (SC-300) exam preparation guide.  

This has been an amazing, yet time consuming experience.  I see why people write books because it becomes something that is exhilarating. 

The book is currently available on the Packt publishing website and you can pre-order the Kindle or Paperback version on Amazon.com.

Here is the US Amazon link to order: 
[Order Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Identity-Access-Administrator-Guide-ebook/dp/B09DDGGKNT/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1866D6QMANR1S&keywords=sc-300+microsoft+identity+and+access+administrator&qid=1645130053&sprefix=sc-300%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-5)

Since the publication released has been announced, it has already made it onto new release lists, including a #1 on one list.  I also found myself this morning at #25 on the Microsoft Certification guides list.

This title will be released on 31 March 2022.
