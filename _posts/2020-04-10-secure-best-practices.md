I have created a video presentation of the break-out session that I was scheduled to present at Ignite the Tour - Chicago on April 16, 2020. As you know, this was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but still wanted to share this information with you. 

Please visit my YouTube page to access this video, and feel free to subscribe as more videos will be posted and become available in the future.

Please join my sessions and the other sessions being provided on April 23-25, 2020 for the Global Azure Virtual bootcamp. Information can be found here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://azureglobalbootcamp2020.azurewebsites.net/">https://azureglobalbootcamp2020.azurewebsites.net/</a>

I invite you to visit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.skillmeup.com" target="_blank">skillmeup.com</a> to view my course on Implementing and Managing Azure Security Center.
